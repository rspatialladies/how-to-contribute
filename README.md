# How to Contribute
Curious about how you can contribute to R-Spatial Ladies? Here are a few ideas! 

1. Invite women you know who are interested in spatial data in R to our new [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/r-spatialladies/shared_invite/enQtMzU1MTIwMjU2NzUyLTBkZjU1NDFiZGU3YzNmN2Y0Y2NiYTM2Njk2ZjI5M2IyMTNiNjI3ZDQ4MzEyMjQxNjM2YWU2ZGVkZWRiYmU1ZDM). 

2. Contribute to our [shared resources Github](https://github.com/rspatialladies/rspatial-resources) with resources you've found helpful when learning #rspatial.

3. Do you know of women doing interesting spatial work in R? Reach out to them and ask if they'd be interested in being profiled for our (soon-to-be-set-up) blog!

4. Tag interesting spatial work you're doing on Twitter with the #rspatialladies hashtag.

5. Have you given a talk at a R-Ladies Meetup about spatial data? We'd love to link to it.
